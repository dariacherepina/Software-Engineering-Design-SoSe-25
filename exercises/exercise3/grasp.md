1. ### Introduction to GRASP
   GRASP is a set of design principles that help assign responsibilities to objects in an object-oriented system. It serves as a learning aid to make object design methodical, rational, and explainable. The core idea revolves around responsibilities, which are categorized into:

Doing: Performing actions (e.g., calculations, initiating processes).

Knowing: Holding information (e.g., data, relationships).

2. ### Key GRASP Principles
   The document outlines nine GRASP principles, with detailed explanations for the following:

#### a.Low Coupling
Problem: How to reduce dependencies between classes to improve reusability and minimize the impact of changes.

Solution: Assign responsibilities to classes to minimize coupling (dependencies).

Example:

A Register class should not directly create a Payment object (high coupling). Instead, delegate this to the Sale class (low coupling).

Benefits: Easier maintenance, understanding, and reuse.

#### b. High Cohesion
Problem: How to manage complexity by keeping classes focused.

Solution: Assign responsibilities so that each class has a single, well-defined purpose.

Example:

A Register class handling payments, sales, and inventory would have low cohesion. Splitting these into separate classes improves cohesion.

Benefits: Easier to maintain, understand, and reuse.

#### c. Information Expert
Problem: Where to assign a responsibility?

Solution: Assign it to the class with the most information needed to fulfill it (the "expert").

Example:

The Sale class calculates the total price because it knows about SalesLineItem and ProductSpecification.

Benefits: Natural alignment with data, reducing representational gaps.

#### d. Creator
Problem: Who should create an instance of a class?

Solution: Assign creation responsibility to a class that:

Aggregates/contains the object.

Uses the object closely.

Has initialization data.

Example:

Sale creates SalesLineItem because it contains line items.

Benefits: Promotes low coupling and logical grouping.

#### e. Controller
Problem: Who handles system events (e.g., user input)?

Solution: Assign to a class representing:

The overall system (facade controller, e.g., POSSystem).

A use case scenario (use case controller, e.g., ProcessSaleHandler).

Benefits: Separates UI from logic, improves reusability.

### 3. Other GRASP Principles (Briefly Mentioned)
   Polymorphism: Use interfaces to handle variations in behavior.

Indirection: Introduce intermediaries to reduce direct coupling.

Pure Fabrication: Create artificial classes to achieve high cohesion/low coupling.

Protected Variations: Design systems to be stable against changes in specific components.

### 4. Discussion and Trade-offs
   Low Coupling vs. High Cohesion: These often complement each other but may conflict with other principles (e.g., Expert).

Contraindications:

Overusing subclassing can increase coupling (prefer composition).

Extreme low coupling may lead to bloated classes.

Expert may conflict with separation of concerns (e.g., database logic in domain classes).

### 5. Practical Examples
   Payment Processing: Delegating payment creation to Sale instead of Register reduces coupling.

Graph Algorithms: A Graph class should manage node visitation flags (Expert) rather than an external Algorithm class.

### 6. Key Takeaways
   GRASP provides a systematic way to assign responsibilities.

Focus on balancing principles (e.g., coupling vs. cohesion).

Real-world intuition often aligns with GRASP (e.g., "the expert does the work").

Design trade-offs are inevitable; use principles to guide decisions.

Conclusion
GRASP is foundational for object-oriented design, emphasizing clarity, maintainability, and flexibility. By applying these principles, developers can create systems that are easier to understand, modify, and extend. The document uses concrete examples (e.g., POS system) to illustrate how these abstract concepts translate into practical design decisions.
